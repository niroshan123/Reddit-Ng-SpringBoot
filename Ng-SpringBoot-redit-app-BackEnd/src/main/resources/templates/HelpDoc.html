For Your Knowledge if you are reffering my repo :)

First Create all the Models with the help of Database Schema
Then add the repositry package and design the basic repository extending JpaRepository
Create Config Package => SecurityConfig class by extending WebSecurityadaptor and then overide the configure(HttpSecurity httpSecurity)
in order to make do all authorization
Then create the controller package and add the AuthController class by adding /signup post mapping and add the RegisterRequest as @Requestbody

Then create the dto( Data transfer object that carries through the request body) That have the username email password

Then create the authService class in Service packege to call from the Authcontroller. And in the authService we create the signup method to do the
opertion with  database

Then create mailTemplate.html to display the email for the user.

After saving the user it is to be generate a token with the user details.



then create the token in authService itself with the help of VerifcationToken class and save that created token using VerificationTokenRepository

Now we Have created the token with the user details and what now wants to do is that we have to send an email to that perticular mail.

So for that we create a service called MailService and in this service we create a method call sendMail
== mailService.sendMail(new NotificationEmail(""Please Activate your Account",
user.getEmail(), "Thank you for signing up to Spring Reddit, " +
"please click on the below url to activate your account : " +
"http://localhost:8080/api/auth/accountVerification/" + token")

and then in the sendEmail method there are some configuration to do and code about the mail sending function with the help of javamail sender


<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf</artifactId>
</dependency> this dependency help in sending activation mail

===================User Verification Async process============
create a GetMapping with accountVerification/{token} this is what we send to the email so this link is what we get as a get
so authService.verifyAccount() we have to create a method verifyAccount to find the token in the verifyTokenRepository
verifyAccount(token){
Optional</VerificationToken> verificationToken=verificationTokenRepository.findByToken(token);
since this is optional when there is no perticular token we can send a error msg
if ther is a token then that token is sent to fetchandexe method to find whether there is a user with that user by getting the user name
in the token by calling userrepository and storing in User user
and if no user send the exception
and if ther is a user then
user.setEnabled(true);
userRepository.save(user);

finally  return new ResponseEntity<>("Account Activated", HttpStatus.OK); in AuthController GetMapping

===================Login Functionality============
AuthService to grab the authentication request and match with the user credentials then create UserNamePasswordAuthenticationToken
this UserNamePasswordAuthenticationToken will pass to AuthenticationManager which taken care of all athentications this AuthenticationManager
will use an interface called UserDetailService which we have to implement to chechk with database
